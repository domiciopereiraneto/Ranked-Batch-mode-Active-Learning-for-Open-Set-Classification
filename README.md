# Ranked Batch-mode Active Learning for Open Set Classification

This is the code used to produce the results that are present in our paper. The ranked_batch_active_learning_with_open_set_comparison notebook has by default all the parameters necessary to replicate our results. The results notebook performs post-processing and generates the plots. The openkneighbors script is our modified KNN for open set classification.

It is necessary to download and extract the CIFAR-10 batches from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html and place them in a folder called cifar-10-batches-py in order to make the scripts work.
